# TempleOS Explorers Edition

TempleOS was developed by the late Terry Davis and is a true testiment to what what a person can achieve, he single handedly developed and built the OS using a a compiler he also developed, the system is "alien" to all its contemparies where no extern code or binarys can be introduced into the system (easily) or exported and run ourside the environment.

The system has two pre-built binarys the Kernel and Compiler, at bootup the runtime environment is Just In Time (JIT) compiled and executed. The System is fast, the compiler is fast, in VirtualBox system startup time for me is around 0.4 seconds and that includes the compilation time of the runtime environment.

Explorers Edition builds on top of the base TempleOS to add new hardware support and installation options. 

What I intepret as Terrys intention for the OS will be honoured what I interpret as Gods intention will not, with the Ultimate Goal being a light weight Hobby OS, that is a fun place to explore and develop new ideas. Something that stands apart from the main stream Commercial OS's and is developed independantly and encourages users to get in and get their hands dirty and try new things.

Initial Goals
The initial Goals are to bring the core of the OS up so it can be installed and run on (as many as possible) x64 PC's

* 32 Bit VESA Graphics
* AHCI Support
* More installation options (Maybe something using LILI style Virtualbox on a USB stick, Grub USB stick with a RAM ISO Image)
* Focus on the core Kernel
* Ability to easily manage code changes in source control
* Add newer OP codes to the assembler and compiler 
* Develop hardware graphics driver
