#Switch to ZealOS as the 'Master'

ZealOS has made some good progress into furthing the case of hardware support and continuing 
to ensure the TempleOS can remain viable going forwards.

I have created a pre switch branch at the last where th eParent is TempleOS

The change means there are some significant around file names where under ZealOZ the source code files
are .ZC instead of .HC
